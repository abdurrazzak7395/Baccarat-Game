This repository contains all folders/files of my implementation of the popular casino game "Baccarat".
In order to access the contents, download the zip file and open within the IDE of your choice.
Alternatively, you can simply clone this repository. 
Once you have access to the project on your local machine, you will need to run the program to play the game.
In order to do this, access the terminal and run the command "mvn clean compile exec:java"
Happy playing!
